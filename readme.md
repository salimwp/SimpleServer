# Python Simple Server

These two applications help create a simple server to test network centric applications.  They act as an echo server.  Currently the IP Address and Port is hard coded and can be changed by modifying the IP and PORT variables in the files.

To start the server simply run the following command for the UDP server:
```sh
$ python udpSimpleServer.py
```
or the following command for the TCP server:
```sh
$ python tcpSimpleServer.py
```
